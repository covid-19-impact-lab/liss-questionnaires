This is the documentation of the LISS Panel questionnaire on the CoViD-19 pandemic that was fielded in April 2020.

The questions are documented in Dutch and English. The table of contents below contains overviews of the questions in both languages. The questions are ordered according to their appearance in the questionnaire or according to topic. The overview pages link to every question. Each page contains the question and a screenshot from the questionnaire as it was shown to respondents.

In this questionnaire, respondents were asked about their living situation during the coronavirus pandemic. Topics covered by the questions include repeated questions from wave 1 on work situation and childcare adjustments as well as new questions about alcohol consumption and smoking, economic expectations, and social contacts.
