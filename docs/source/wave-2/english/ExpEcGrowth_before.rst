`ExpEcGrowth_before` â€“ Expected Economic Growth Before
==================================================

We are interested in your expectations of the future development of the Dutch economy as measured by the real growth rates of gross domestic product (that is, net of inflation), and how the impact of the corona virus has affected your expectations. On average, the Dutch economy has grown by around 2.5% in the years 2017-2019. 

First, we would like to know the growth rates of the Dutch economy you expected for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 before there was a sign of the coronavirus crisis.
