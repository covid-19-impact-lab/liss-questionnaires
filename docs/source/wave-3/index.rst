Documentation - Wave 3
======================

This is the documentation of the LISS Panel questionnaire on the CoViD-19 pandemic that was fielded in May 2020.

The questions are documented in Dutch and English under :ref:`wave3_questions_dutch` and :ref:`wave3_questions_english` respectively. Each page contains the question and a screenshot from the questionnaire as it was shown to respondents.

In this questionnaire, individuals were asked recurring questions from previous questionnaires about their working situation and hours, (mental) health, concerns, and expected durations of restrictions. The questionnaire also included detailed questions about the application and participation in different government schemes for companies as well as how CoViD-19 may affect employment and retirement of respondents. Finally, the questionnaire also included a series of questions about school-aged children living in the household and how the pandemic has been affecting their everyday life.
