This page contains the documentation of questionnaires created by the `CoViD-19 Impact Lab <https://covid-19-impact-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ in the `LISS Panel <https://www.lissdata.nl/>`_. The questionnaires are used to survey participants of the `LISS Panel <https://www.lissdata.nl/>`_ on their experiences, expectations, and socio-economic situation during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. The surveys are divided into multiple waves, all of which will be documented here.

The results from the surveys can be explored in an `interactive dashboard <https://covid-19-impact-lab.iza.org/app>`_.
