=============

The following set of questions are about the Coronavirus.

Due to the fact that the LISS Panel contains a representative subset of the population the answers to this questionnaire allow researcher to get a good impression of how the Dutch population copes with the outbreak of the coronavirus. There are also questions included that are asked in comparable samples in Germany and the US, to see whether certain things are done or experienced differently than in the Netherlands.

You will receive several questionnaires about the coronavirus in the upcoming months.
The following questionnaire mainly contains questions about your opinion on the measures taken
by the government. And whether you limit your social life. You also get questions about to which extent the outbreak affects your financial situation.
