Have you applied for an allowance for labour costs for the period June-September (the temporary Emergency Measure Bridging Employment 2.0, abbreviated to NOW 2.0)? The scheme is intended for employers who suffer a loss of turnover of at least 20% due to the coronavirus. They can apply to the UWV for an allowance for labour costs.
