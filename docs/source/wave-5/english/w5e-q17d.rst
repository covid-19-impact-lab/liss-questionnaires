*Routing to the question depends on answer in:* :ref:`w5e-EmploymentStatus` 

Have you submitted an application for income support for self-employed persons for the period June-September (the Temporary bridging scheme for self-employed persons 2.0, abbreviated to Tozo 2.0)? The scheme provides a supplementary livelihood allowance if the income falls below the social minimum due to the corona crisis. And a loan for working capital to absorb liquidity problems as a result of the corona crisis.
