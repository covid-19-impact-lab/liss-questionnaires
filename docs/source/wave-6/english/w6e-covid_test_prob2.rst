Suppose the government asks everyone to test themselves at home for Covid-19 with a test in which you gently wipe the front of your nose with a cotton swab. Suppose the test detects all infected individuals. But, 1 in 100 people who are not infected tests positive. If you test positive, you have to stay in quarantine for five days and have to go through the GGD to have a coronavirus test done.

Suppose the government pays everyone who complies with this request a tax-free amount of money pay. What amount would the government then have to pay to make sure that you and you follow the rules (stay in quarantine and have a coronavirus done via the GGD)? done through the GGD)?
