Suppose the government asks everyone to test themselves at home for Covid-19 with a test in which you gently wipe the front of your nose with a cotton swab. Suppose the test detects all infected individuals. But, 1 in 100 people who are not infected tests positive. If you test positive, you have to stay in quarantine for five days and have to go through the GGD to have a coronavirus test done.

How likely are you to get tested?
You can answer this question on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 stands for definitely not and 100 for definitely yes.
