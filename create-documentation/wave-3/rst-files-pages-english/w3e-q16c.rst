*Routing to the question depends on answer in:* :ref:`w3e-EmploymentStatus`

To the best of your knowledge, has your employer applied for a special tax deferral? If an entrepreneur has payment problems as a result of the corona virus, the company can apply to the tax authorities for a special deferment of payment for all income tax, corporation tax, turnover tax (VAT) and wage tax assessments.

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – Yes, the application has been granted

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – Yes, but the application was rejected

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – Yeah, but I don't know if the application's been granted yet.

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – No, but I think my employer is going to do this

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – No, I don't think it's necessary

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – No, I don't think it's possible

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – No, I don't think it's possible
