What are the chances that the coronavirus crisis will lead to a situation where you have no income or where your income is lower than what you need to cover basic needs and outstanding commitments? 

Basic needs and commitments include basic food, energy bills, insurance, mortgages and other loans, medical expenses, etc.

This is your household's total income. 

You can answer this question on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 means definitely not and 100 means definitely yes.
