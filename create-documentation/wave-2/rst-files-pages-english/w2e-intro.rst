`intro` – Intro
===========

This month you will receive another questionnaire about the coronavirus. Last month, the coronavirus questionnaire was completed by more than 5,400 panel members. And that's great, because it gives researchers a good idea of ​​how the outbreak is managed in the Netherlands. Prime Minister Rutte said it all: this affects us all and is one of the most difficult periods in our history outside wartime. It is therefore important that a lot of research is done. This time we have questions about how you feel, about smoking and drinking behavior, and we ask a number of questions again. We do this to see if anything has changed in your situation or your opinion. You also get questions about how you felt about some of the financial issues before the virus broke out and how you feel about it now. In the coming period you will receive some questionnaires about the coronavirus.
