=================================


:raw-html:`&larr;` :ref:`w3e-q17c` | :ref:`w3e-q17e` :raw-html:`&rarr;` 

*Routing to the question depends on answer in:* :ref:`w3e-EmploymentStatus`

Have you submitted an application for income support for the self-employed (the Temporary bridging scheme for the self-employed, abbreviated to Tozo)? The scheme provides for a supplementary livelihood allowance if the income falls below the social minimum due to the corona crisis. And a loan for working capital to absorb liquidity problems as a result of the corona crisis.

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – Yes, the application has been granted

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – Yes, but the application was rejected

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – Yeah, but I don't know if the application's been granted yet.

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – No, but I'm gonna do this

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – No, I don't think my company qualifies for this

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – No, this is too much red tape

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – No, for another reason

:raw-html:`&#10063;` – I didn't know there was this arrangement
