`intro` â€“ Introduction 
=======================


:ref:`w3e-InfectionDiagnosed` :raw-html:`&rarr;` 


This month you will receive the third questionnaire in the series "Corona outbreak in the Netherlands" on how the coronavirus affects your daily life. You can also participate if you have not completed the previous two questionnaires. A number of the questions from the first two questionnaires will now be asked to you again, to see if your situation has changed two months after the measures were taken compared to when the measures had just been implemented.  Although there are cautiously positive signs, Prime Minister Rutte says "we are far from there". It therefore remains important that research is carried out. In addition to research on health and a person's well-being, research on the economic consequences for those in work, pensioners, and the unemployed is also needed. Based on the situation now, policy should be made for the future, so that any subsequent outbreaks can be dealt with in the right way. Once again: thank you for participating!
